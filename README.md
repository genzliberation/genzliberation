- 👋 Hi, I’m @genzliberation and I believe a leaderless movement needs to be a vision, principle, and system led movement. My name isn't important - my ideas are.
- 👀 I’m interested in seeing the transformation of Kenya and Africa into their greatest potential.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best leverage technology to outreach, engage, organize and mobilize true patriots (wazalendo) and PanAfricanists.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to create and implement mobile pone apps, the internet and social media tools for progressive social transformation. 
- 📫 How to reach me agapeansawaken@gmail.com Agape means God's unconditional love. All that is involved in this endeavor is because of loving God and fellow mankind.
- 😄 Pronouns: Male and female - created HE them. If you think there are more genders - you don't know anything about plumbing. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Youth is not an age-set, it's a mindset. You can be 18 and a dinosaur in mindset, and you can be 80 and be youthful in mindset. 
You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your system. - James Clear
